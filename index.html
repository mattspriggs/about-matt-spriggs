	<h1>About Matt</h1>
	<img src = "./matt.jpg" alt="Matt and Sarah in Jemez National Forest"/>
	<p>
		Matt has been a <strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong> since 1974 when he first
		discovered <strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong> at a local
		<strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong> bar in
		<strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong> Park,
		<strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong>orado after
		<strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong>ing all day with his parents.  It was
		<strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong> gaming and
		<strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong>nology married together that
		would be his <strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong> passion for the remainder of his
		<strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong> life<strong>
		<span style="color: red">!!!</span></strong>
	</p><p>
		Matt is now <strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong>ing into the last stage of his
		<strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong> life and making a bold move into the
		<strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong>nology sector.  A serial
		<strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong>opreneur, Matt will likely end up
		<strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong>ing for himself. Thankfully he
		has other <strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong> passions besides
		<strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong>nology and
		<strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong> gaming including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong> Aikido (Ki-Aikido specifically)</li>
		<li><strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong> Mountain biking</li>
		<li><strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong> Hiking</li>
		<li><strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong> Skiing</li>
		<li><strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong> Hockey and nerd skating</li>
		<li><strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong> Music</li>
		<li><strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong> Art</li>
		<li><strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong> telling of all kinds</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="new">
		After years of <strong><span style="color: red">nerd</span></strong>ing in various fields, Matt is
		<em>FINALLY</em> making a change into a <strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong> field
		with all the other <strong><span style="color: red">Nerds</span></strong> in his class;
		specifically <strong> <span style="color: red">NERD</span>STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT</strong>.  Just to add
		to the chaos of changing careers, Matt and Sarah (a permanent resident of New Zealand) are moving to
		New <strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong>land.  Matt has never been to
		New <strong><span style="color: red">Nerd</span></strong>land but <em>KNOWS</em> that he is ready for
		something completely different from the Southwestern US where he has lived
		<strong class="big">his entire <span style="color: red">NERD</span>-life!</strong>
