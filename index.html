	<h1>About Matt</h1>
	<img src = "./matt.jpg" alt="Matt and Sarah in Jemez National Forest"/>
	<p>
		Matt has been a nerd since 1974 when he first discovered pong at a local bar in Winter Park, Colorado
		after skiing all day with his parents.  It was gaming and technology married together that would be
		his passion for the remainder of his life.
	</p><p>
		Matt is now entering into the last stage of his working life and making a bold move into the
		technology sector.  A serial entrepreneur, Matt will likely end up working for himself. Thankfully he
		has other passions besides technology and gaming including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Aikido (Ki-Aikido specifically)</li>
		<li>Mountain biking</li>
		<li>Hiking</li>
		<li>Skiing</li>
		<li>Hockey and skating</li>
		<li>Music</li>
		<li>Art</li>
		<li>Story telling of all kinds</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="new">
		After years of working in various fields, Matt is <em>FINALLY</em> making a change into a tech field;
		specifically <strong>FULLSTACK WEB DEVELOPMENT</strong>.  Just to add to the chaos of changing careers,
		Matt and Sarah (a permanent resident of New Zealand) are moving to New Zealand.  Matt has never been to
		New Zealand but <em>KNOWS</em> that he is ready for something completely different from the Southwestern
		US where he has lived <strong class="big">his entire life!</strong>
